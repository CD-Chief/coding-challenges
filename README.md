# Coding Challenges Repository

This repository tracks my progress solving algorithm and data structure challenges from LeetCode, HackerRank, and other platforms.

I update this repo regularly with new problems, solution notes, and learnings as part of my coding practice journey.

## Repository Overview

- Purpose: A personal practice repository to collect solved problems, notes, and strategies for interview preparation and continuous learning.
- Content: Problem solutions (organized by platform and topic), explanation notes, small helper utilities, and a weekly progress log.

## How to Use

- Browse by topic folders under `Leetcode/`.
- Each solution file (should) contains a short thought process to my solution at the top as well as **Issue :** when i realize my solution does not work
- I Add new solutions as I solve problems and keep file names consistent (e.g., `<problem-number>. <title>.py`).

## Lessons Learned (newest first)

- Learnt how to operate with linkedLists
- Don't always need to store the var's passed in from a method
- Learnt about comparing binary trees via structure
- Learnt about dynamic programming
- Go about recursion systematically (base case etc)
- Visualize the problem and the solution before starting
- Don't make assumptions unless explicitly stated
- Need to handle the last element in an array when doing comparisons in a loop
- Learnt to use negative indexes to iterate from the back of lists
- Learnt to use pythons switch case (match case)
- Learnt about using slicing to manipulate strings
- Simple edge cases (like empty strings or one-letter inputs) are crucial!
- Learned about generator expressions and how they can provide memory-efficient iteration for large datasets.
- Python’s built-in methods can be combined (`join`, `reversed`, `isalnum`).
