# Coding Challenges Repository

This repository tracks my progress solving algorithm and data structure challenges from LeetCode, HackerRank, and other platforms.

I update this repo regularly with new problems, solution notes, and learnings as part of my coding practice journey.

## Repository Overview

- Purpose: A personal practice repository to collect solved problems, notes, and strategies for interview preparation and continuous learning.
- Content: Problem solutions (organized by platform and topic), explanation notes, small helper utilities, and a weekly progress log.

## How to Use

- Browse by platform and topic folders under `Leetcode/`.
- Each solution file contains a short explanation at the top when helpful.
- Add new solutions as you solve problems; keep file names consistent (e.g., `<problem-number>. <title>.py`).

## Progress Log

### Week 1 (Oct 20â€“Oct 26, 2025)
Solved 1 problem, Merge sorted array.
I now plan to solve 1 problem everday as well as 2 Hackerrank tests per week


## Lessons Learned

- Pythonâ€™s built-in methods can be combined powerfully (`join`, `reversed`, `isalnum`).
- Learned about generator expressions and how they can provide memory-efficient iteration for large datasets.
- Simple edge cases (like empty strings or one-letter inputs) are crucial!
